name: adr
description: Record an artcheck planning or design decision as an ADR in docs/adr/NNNN-<slug>.md and keep the docs/adr/README.md index current. Use whenever the user makes a choice between alternatives, asks why something was chosen, or when an accepted decision must be replaced or retired.
argument-hint: "[decision title]"

Record the decision: $ARGUMENTS

## Writing a new ADR

1. Number: next four-digit number in `docs/adr/`. File: `docs/adr/NNNN-<english-kebab-slug>.md`.
2. Draft the ADR from the template below and **show the draft to the user first**. Write the file only after the user approves the draft. If the user declines, discard it.
3. New ADRs start as `Status: Proposed`. Change to `Status: Accepted` only after the user confirms the decision itself.
4. Add a row to the index `docs/adr/README.md`, and update the row whenever the status changes.
5. Link the ADR from the current cycle's `design-delta.md` 결정 기록 section.

## Content rules

- 이유: quote only what the user said in this conversation. If the user gave no reason, write `[이유 미확인]`. Never write a reason the user did not give.
- Every rejected alternative gets its own 채택하지 않은 이유. Use the user's words; if they only chose without saying why, write `[이유 미확인]`.
- Record significant choices only (module boundaries, data ownership, external data sources, API style, events vs calls). Naming and formatting choices do not need an ADR.
- A past decision recorded late keeps its original date and says so in 배경.

## Status lifecycle

`Proposed → Accepted → Superseded by NNNN | Deprecated`

- **Superseded**: a new ADR replaces it. Write the new ADR with `Supersedes: NNNN`, then change only the old file's status line to `Status: Superseded by NNNN`.
- **Deprecated**: the decision no longer applies and nothing replaces it (for example, the feature was removed). Change only the status line to `Status: Deprecated`.
- An Accepted ADR is otherwise never edited. A hook blocks any other change.

## Answering "why did we choose X?"

Read `docs/adr/README.md`, open the matching ADRs, and answer from their 배경, 결정 and 이유. If none matches, say so and offer to record one.
